          <p>
            I have completed several projects that have allowed me to apply my
            knowledge and further develop my skills. For example, I have built a
            web application using React, Node.js and MongoDB, where I
            implemented features such as user authentication and real-time data
            management. Take a look in some of projects that I've been working
            on.

              attendance tracking PWA that provides a detailed record of your
              employees' work hours. The app automatically records clock-in and
              clock-out times but also offers the flexibility to manually input
              hours for specific instances for management system.
